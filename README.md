# Technologies
* Front End
    * React
* Back End Server
    * Rails Backend
        * Faker for generating Students and Teachers
    * Authentication O-auth

* Database 
    * Postgresql








# Pre challenges
* Making multiple servers talk to eachother
* SPA page routes are viewable to everyone, so how to make this less of an issue
    * By allowing teachers to be students, we add functionality to spa's allowing any user to access a path, the trick will be the data coming from the server side
    * This project would have been better as a non spa because of this issue, however SPA's have better user experience





# Issues
* Handling Relations vs Inheritence 
    * Cant build inheritance tree, more like only one level because that would be changing the structure of the database probably.
    * Usable in situations where all the tables would be exactly the same

* Financial Accounts have an associated person id because it is based off a user. This is sloppy and should be removed when possible. 

* When one financial account is created a user account is also created, this is a bit sloppy, should refactor.
